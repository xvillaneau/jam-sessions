# This is where you should be writing tests, your actual code should go in

# Writing tests is optional but recommended. Here's a tip: take the examples
# from the instructions, and write tests for those cases here.

import decoder

# Here's an example of a test, add more as you progress!

assert decoder.part_1(test_1) == "Hello, World!"

# Keep this line at the end, don't touch it
print("All tests passed")
